      <h1>Inspiring Websites</h1>

        <h2>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h2>

        <ul>
          <li><a href=www.gnosh.co.uk>www.gnosh.co.uk</a> </li>
            <p>Web page for a UK based appetizer dip company.</p>
          <li><a href=www.morethan20.com>www.morethan20.com</a></li>
            <p>The business advertising site for a Buffalo NY freelance photographer.</p>
        </ul>

        <h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance? What makes them similar and different?</h2>

          <p> Gnosh's web page utilizes large image elements to draw users into interacting with the few pieces of content on the page in order to gain a better understanding of the company's standards and products. Many of these short pieces of content help the user navigate through the distractingly large images by serving as clickable links to distinct sections on the page which highlight the company's relevant information. </p>

          <p>Morethan20's web page comparably seems to contain much more empty or negative space, drawing the user further down the page with small background stylings. The images included are used to provide contrast against the harsh style of the sub-headings and thereby soften their tone. The simplistic standard used here, including a repeating of content width and columnal placement on the page, allows the photographer employing the site to instead highlight her artistic and creative mind through the image usage.</p>

          <p>Both however rely heavily on imagery to allow flow among the elements. Element size and color decide the contents heirarchy with the focal points for both being large stylized titles placed at the top of each web page.
