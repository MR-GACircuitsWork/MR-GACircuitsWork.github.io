      <h1>About Me</h1>

        <p>I'm a non-profit development coordinator/CRM Manager, living in New York City. I became interested in Front-End Web Design and Development because I've always loved learning new languages and am interested to see how transitioning into Web Design languages will grow my professional contributions and numerous personal projects.</p>

      <h4>My Mission</h4>
        <p>As I learn more about front-end, I hope to one day build a website for myself as a freelance writer and to also provide secondary support for the website developer of my non-profit development team. This is because I love the work my current employer does and would like to be able to continue with them long term while supported by a self-managing, flexible, secondary career.</p>
